# Practicum Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Web Development program at Practicum by Yandex. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

My plans on improving the project would be to make the "Book a table" button square. I would also like to remove the up and down arrow from the "Number of guests" input field as well.
